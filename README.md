# FileBlue
An app for Bluetooth file transfer based on the bluetooth chat app on the android developer site.
This is an app for sending files over Bluetooth to another device. 
It is a work in progress and uses the open source xml layout from the android bluetooth chat app off of the developers site. 
This is an education project. As of now the files transfer but the data comes out jumbled. 
As in an Image is only clear at the top portion. 
Any pointers are appreciated.
